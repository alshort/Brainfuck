# Brainfuck
A small, Java-based interpreter for the esoteric programming language "Brainfuck".

To operate the program:
Call the program through the command line and enter in as a command-line argument the path of the File you wish to interpret
--> e.g. java BrainfuckInterpreter helloworld.txt

(This project is set up as an Eclipse project so debugging and passing in the program in the configs works equally as well).
